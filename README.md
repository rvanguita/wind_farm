# Wind Farm




## [Dataset Description](https://zenodo.org/records/5516552)

- **Location:** The data were collected from both offshore and inland wind farms.
- **Environmental Variables:** Seven environmental variables are available for the offshore wind farm (V, D, rho, H, I, Sa, Sb), while on the inland wind farm, humidity measurements and above-hub wind shear are not available, resulting in five variables (V, D, rho, I, Sb).
- **Measurement Sources:** The variables were measured by sensors on the meteorological masts, while the output power (y) was measured at the wind turbines.
- **Data Collection Periods:**
  - For WT1 and WT2: July 30, 2010, through July 31, 2011.
  - For WT3 and WT4: April 29, 2010, through April 30, 2011.
  - For WT5 and WT6: January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009.
- **Association:** Each meteorological mast is associated with two wind turbines, meaning the environmental variables measured at a met mast are paired with the output power measurements of two associated turbines.
